Note: This is the front-end code to a cross-domain data persistance solution with specific applications.

EDIT: FOR CHROME USERS! Using the new l2inobutton.js (less clicks, gets work done faster) 
it is recommended to use some sort of mod, addon, 
extension for your browser in order to force all popup windows into tabs.
This allows for quick access to the bookmarklet for chrome.
I would say this is a semi-dependency and my favorite extension is called 'one window'
download 'One Window' at https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/one-window/papnlnnbddhckngcblfljaelgceffobn

Usage: ( http://clipget-64labs.aws.af.cm/bookmarklet )

To make use of this l2i.js, you must have a linkedin and an insightly account.
From there you may run the l2i.js script on a user or company profile to scrape
the LinkedIn data and browse to insightly, add a new contact or organization, and run the 
l2i.js script once again to paste the scraped data.

The back-end is a Node http server with mongodb for data storage (overkill).
