Note: This is the front-end code to a cross-domain data persistance solution with specific applications.

Usage: ( http://clipget-64labs.aws.af.cm/bookmarklet )

To make use of this l2i.js, you must have a linkedin and an insightly account.
From there you may run the l2i.js script on a user or company profile to scrape
the LinkedIn data and browse to insightly, add a new contact or organization, and run the 
l2i.js script once again to paste the scraped data.

The back-end is a Node http server with mongodb for data storage (overkill).
